# Siege++ Core

The core mod for Siege++, based on the excellent Siege+ by ZycaR.

Please see the Siege++Collection for the current collection of releases.

## Development notes

NS2 does not currently compile/copy sound files properly. Please use the included builder_setup.xml if you are doing work with sound files. Because of this, we have comitted the sound files in the output folder to the repo.
